    "In addition to the supply and demand constraints sometimes transportation problems can have capacity restrictions such that each route will have a maximum number of units that may be shipped along that route. (Similar to worker availability in the worker scheduling problem.)\n",

    "For this problem there are 3 warehouses that ship the same product to 21 stores.  The supply at the warehouses, demand at the stores, unit shipping costs, and route capacities are stored in the `transpSingle.xlsx` file in the `data` folder.  Use the `openpyxl` package to read the problem data into lists and nested lists.  Once you have the problem data converted into dictionaries, then adapt the transportation code in the lesson to minimize the total shipping cost.  You'll need to add the extra capacity constraint to give an upper bound to the number of units shipped on each route.  Your code should also use Technique 3 to eliminate unneeded decision variables.\n",

However, because shipping costs have been increasing, the alternative of using ships to make some of the deliveries is being investigated. This alternative would require the company to invest in some ships. Except for these investment costs, the shipping costs in thousands of dollars per million board feet by rail and by water (when feasible) would be the following for each route:\n",
