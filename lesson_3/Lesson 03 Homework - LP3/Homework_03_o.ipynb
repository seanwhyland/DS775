The supply at the warehouses, demand at the stores, unit shipping costs, and route capacities are stored in the `transpSingle.xlsx` file in the `data` folder.  Use the `openpyxl` package to read the problem data into lists and nested lists.  Once you have the problem data converted into dictionaries, then adapt the transportation code in the lesson to minimize the total shipping cost.

Your code should also use Technique 3 to eliminate unneeded decision variables.\n",

    "Alabama Atlantic is a lumber company that has three sources of wood and five markets to be supplied. The annual availability of wood at sources 1, 2, and 3 is 15, 20, and 15 million board feet, respectively. The amount that can be sold annually at markets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 11, 12, 9, 10, and 8 million board feet, respectively.  In the past the company has shipped the wood by train. However, because shipping costs have been increasing, the alternative of using ships to make some of the deliveries is being investigated. This alternative would require the company to invest in some ships. Except for these investment costs, the shipping costs in thousands of dollars per million board feet by rail and by water (when feasible) would be the following for each route:\n",
