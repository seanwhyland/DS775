Should the People’s Republic of China continue its economic renaissance, the company hopes to use its current base to expand operations to the mainland. International Textile has mills in the Bahamas, Hong Kong, Korea, Nigeria, and Venezuela, each weaving fabrics out of two or more raw fibers: cotton, polyester, and/or silk. The mills service eight company distribution centers.  Cotton supplies and demands at the distribution center are shown below.  Shipping costs depend on both distances and other factors and are shown below.  \n",

To turn this into a balanced problem so that our previous code can be applied add an extra distribution center called 'Dummy' to absorb the extra supply.  Set the demand at the dummy distribution center so that total supply and total demand are balanced.  You can learn more here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomjobs.com/e-university/quantitative-techniques-for-management-tutorial-297/unbalanced-transportation-problem-9888.html\">Unbalanced Transportation Problems</a>. Finally, set the costs of shipping to the dummy distribution center since nothing will actually be shipped.\n",
