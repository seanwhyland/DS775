The json file `Caps48.json` in the data folder has both the distance matrix and the coordinates of the cities for plotting.  Note the distance of typical random tour is something like 80,000,000 meters and we're looking for something under 18,000,000 meters.  Your initial temperature has to be large enough to allow large moves on this scale and you'll have to increase `max_moves_no_improve` as well.  You should plot the progress of the search, like in the lesson, and you should plot the final result on the map of the United States as we did last week (that code is given in a cell below). Included a value for the random seed so that your results are reproducible.  Report a search that gives total distance < 18,000,000 meters.

    "Genetic algorithms are great for exploring a large solution space, but not so good at refining the details when close to an optimal solution.  For this reason genetic algorithms are often combined with local search.  The idea is that at each generation some or all of the individuals in the population are replaced by the result of a local search.  We'll explore this by using the 2-opt local search for TSP to refine the three worst tours in each generation.  Create a new customGA() algorithm called customGA_TSP_LS() and include this code at the beginning of the while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# replace 3 worst individuals with local searches\n",
    "pop.sort(key=lambda x:x.fitness.values,reverse=True)\n",
    "num_loc_search = 3\n",
    "for i in range(num_loc_search):\n",
    "    best_tour, best_dist, iterations = two_opt(list(pop[i]),distance_matrix)\n",
    "    pop[i] = creator.Individual(best_tour)\n",
    "    pop[i].fitness.values = (best_dist,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This finds the three worst tours and does a 2-opt local search on each and then replaces the results in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need this version of the 2-opt search that uses the distance matrix:"
