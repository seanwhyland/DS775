    "For the objective function, `fitness_districts` we count the number of districts won by republicans.  Instead of checking each potential solution to see if it's feasible (between 150 and 350 voters in each district) we subtract the total number of thousands by which each district is out of bounds.  This approach to optimization is called a **penalty function method**.  It doesn't prevent infeasible solutions, but it strongly penalizes them so that when the function is optimized the solution generally will be feasible.  Note that in the table above we have several districts that too many or two few voters, when we compute the fitness of that assignment to districts it is negative because of the penalty term."
