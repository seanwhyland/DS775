He believes that 0.1 is just about right as the prior probability of an improving economy, but is quite uncertain about how to split the remaining probabilities between a stable economy and a worsening economy. Therefore, he now wishes to do sensitivity analysis with respect to these latter two prior probabilities.\n",

He currently has been offered three major investments and he would like to choose one. The first one is a conservative investment that would perform very well in an improving economy and only suffer a small loss in a worsening economy. The second is a speculative investment that would perform extremely well in an improving economy but would do very badly in a worsening economy. The third is a counter- cyclical investment that would lose some money in an improving economy but would perform well in a worsening economy.\n",

He is pessimistic about where the economy is headed, and so has assigned prior probabilities of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively, to these three scenarios. He also estimates that his profits under these respective scenarios are those given by the following table:\n",
